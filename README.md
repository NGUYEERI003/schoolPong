# schoolPong!
**schoolPong is some random HTML Pong clone I made for a school project.**
Forked from [aznguymp4/schoolPong](https://github.com/aznguymp4/schoolPong), which is my main account...

- `BallSpeed` starts at 20
- `BallSpeed` and `PlayerSpeed` increases every time the ball collides into something.
- You can play it *locally* with another friend (☹).
- Control guide is at the bottom of the page.
- This fork is specifically so that it can be accessed from school because my custom domain is blocked.
